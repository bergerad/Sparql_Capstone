# Sparql_Capstone

Here are the tasks we need to do: 

Webpage for the semantic web
- Visual Examples
- RDF Explanation 

Webpage for DBPedia
- Example of types and prefixes
- Go over Barack Obama site (or any other thing really)

Webpage for Sparql               
- What is it based on? (SQL)
- What is it used for? (querying any relational database that uses triples)

Webpage for Sparql Queries     
- Sample queries (modal windows that pop up solution)

Another Webpage for Sparql Queries
- Multilevel queries
- Queries that have different parts of the tuple as variables
- Queries that act like a venn diagram and find everything that two or more tuples have in common


EXTRA IF WE HAVE TIME
Make a sample database ourselves to show that Sparql doesn't have to just be Dbpedia
